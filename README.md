# Kaggle-Credit-Risk-Assessment
This project explores credit risk assessment using three models: Random Forest, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), and a hybrid approach combining both. The models are evaluated using a credit card dataset, with a focus on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining supervised and unsupervised techniques.
